## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.5] - 2022-11-12

### Added

- Improve automatic avatar rig bone reference solving.
- Improve automatic generation of body IK setup in avatar automatic setup.
- Add UxrWristTorsionIKSolver component when torsion bones are found in avatar.
- Improve UxrStandardAvatarController inspector when IK is selected but rig has no nodes.
- Add TrackedHandPose to UxrControllerInputCapabilities enum and applied to Valve Index.
- Add public method SolveBodyIK() to still use body IK when AvatarMode is UpdateExternally.
- Add support to isolate the hand part of the mesh in the hand preview poses if the hands
  are in the same mesh as the body.

### Changed

- Set avatar rig type to full/half body when body bones are found in the avatar rig.

### Fixed

- Fix UxrWristTorsionInfo, UxrWristTorsionIKSolver and UxrAvatarArmInfo to generate
  correct data on all avatar rig coordinate systems.
- Fix components that don't override Reset() or OnValidate().
- Fix body IK when no neck bone is present.
- Fix Valve Index controllers not sending UI input events when adopting a hand pose
  with the middle finger curled.
- Fix bug in avatar finger bone reference solving if the finger has already data.

## [0.9.4] - 2022-10-29

### Added

- Add IUxrGrabbableModifier interface to create components that control certain parts
  of an UxrGrabbableObject. The UxrGrabbableObject inspector automatically disables the
  controlled UI sections and has also capability to show/hide the controlled parameters.
  The goal is to provide a scalable way to extend grabbable functionality by adding
  modifier components to the object.
- Add Reset() and OnValidate() to the overridable Unity methods in UxrComponent.
- Add ConstraintsFinished to UxrGrabbableObject to create logic after custom constraints
  have been applied.
- Add constants to UxrGrabbableObjectEditor for UxrGrabbableObject field names.
- Add "Any" variations to GetButtonsPress/GetButtonsTouch when multiple buttons are
  specified so that any button in the set is enough to meet the criteria instead of all.
- Add EnumExt for Enum extensions.
- Add static events to UxrControllerInput to receive events whenever any controller
  sends input data.

### Changed

- Change UxrApplyConstraintsEventArgs to contain the UxrGrabber instead of UxrGrabbableObject.
  The UxrGrabbableObject can still be accessed using the GrabbedObject property from
  the grabber.
- Use ConstraintsFinished in UxrManipulationHapticFeedback in order to process object
  after custom constraints have been applied.  
- Rename UxrLocomotionTeleportBaseEditor to UxrTeleportLocomotionBaseEditor.
- Update example scene prefabs so that they show the cyborg grab poses by default.

### Fixed

- Fix support for PicoXR controller detection on newer versions of the PicoXR Unity SDK.
- Remove Universal Additional Camera Data scripts added incorrectly to BRP avatar variants.
  Affected avatars are SmallHandsAvatar_BRP, BigHandsAvatar_BRP and CyborgAvatar_BRP.
- Fix joystick directional buttons (left/right/up/down) when getting ignored input.
- Fix bug in UxrGrabbableObjectEditor that under some circumstances throws exceptions
  when previewing grab poses.
- Fix UxrGrabbableObject constrained rotation on a single axis not working correctly when
  parent has different axes.
- Fix UxrTeleportSpawnCollider not raising Teleported event.

## [0.9.3] - 2022-10-24

### Added

- Add support to use UltimateXR through Unity Package Manager using git URL.

### Changed

- Change folder structure to adapt to the Unity Package Manager layout:
  https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-layout.html

## [0.9.2] - 2022-10-18

### Fixed

- Fix UxrGrabbableObject editor methods that caused compiler errors when creating a build.
- Fix UxrGrabbableObject startup so that component can be added to an object at runtime.

## [0.9.1] - 2022-10-13

### Changed

- Improve some UxrGrabbableObject parameter tooltips.

### Fixed

- Fix GameObjectExt.GetBounds and GetLocalBounds exceptions when no renderers are found.
- Fix GameObjectExt.GetBounds not computing value correctly.

## [0.9.0] - 2022-10-13

### Added

- Add new UxrGrabbableObject constraints functionality with improved manipulation.
- Add UxrGrabbableObject gizmos to visualize rotation/translation constraints.
- Add new UxrGrabbableObject rotation/translation constraint modes.
- Add support to UxrGrabbableObject for rotation constraints on all 3 axes.
- Add support to UxrGrabbableObject for a single rotation constraint over 360 degrees.
- Improve manipulation behavior when grabbing objects to detect the grip and know which part
  of the hand creates more leverage.
- Add possibility to parent to destination in locomotion components: UxrTeleportLocomotion and 
  UxrSmoothLocomotion.
- Add new teleport methods to UxrManager to teleport relative to moving objects.
- Add new functionality to GameObjectExt to compute bounds recursively.
- Add new functionality to MeshExt to compute skinned mesh vertices and bone influences.
- Add new misc functionality to FloatExt, IntExt, Vector3Ext, Vector3IntExt and TransformExt.
- Add new data to UxrAvatarRigInfo.
- Add versioning to avatar rig info serialization and automatic updating.
- Add IUxrLogger interface to unify logging in managers.
- Add logging to UxrWeaponManager.
- Add new properties to UxrComponent with initial Transform data.
- Add new UxrAxis properties and functionality.
- Add possibility to access avatar grabbers at edit-time.

### Changed

- Improve all UxrGrabbableObject and hand grab/release/constrain transitions.
- Move UxrGrabbableObject constraints to the top of the inspector.
- Replace GrabAndMove/RotateAroundAxis manipulation modes by new constraint system.
- Change UxrGrabbableObject rotation and translation constraints reference.
  Rotations are performed around the grabbable object local axes.
  Translations are performed along the initial grabbable object local axes.
- Improve UxrAvatarRig reference solving.

### Removed

- Remove parent reference to UxrGrabbableObject rotation/translation constraints.
- Remove UxrManipulationMode. New constraint system and UxrRotationProvider is used instead.

### Fixed

- Fix pre-caching triggered by non-local avatars. Only local avatar triggers pre-caching now.
- Fix locomotion components detecting avatar or grabbed objects as obstacles.
- Fix locomotion not working correctly on moving platforms.
- Fix UxrWeaponManager not tracking actors correctly.
- Fix UxrMagnifyingGlassUrp error when not using URP.
- Fix CyborgAvatar_URP base to use index controllers correctly.
- Fix some CyborgAvatar_BRP base materials that were using the URP variants.

## [0.8.4] - 2022-08-05

### Added

- Add new ULTIMATEXR_UNITY_TMPRO symbol when TextMeshPro is available.
- Add support to UxrTextContentTween for TextMeshPro text components.

### Changed

- UxrTextContentTween.Animate() now uses a GameObject as target parameter so that
  either a Unity UI Text component or a TextMeshPro text component can be animated.

### Fixed

- Fix UxrInterpolator.InterpolateText() use of rich text color tag.
- Fix UxrAvatar to avoid infinite loops when enumerating the avatar prefab chain.
- Fix UxrAvatarRigInfo.GetWorldElbowAxis() for left side when T-pose is found.
- Fix UxrAvatarRig.ClearRigElements() to clear missing references.
- Fix missing ULTIMATEXR_UNITY_URP in UxrMagnifyingGlassUrp to avoid URP hard requirement.

### Fixed

- Fix UxrLaserPointerRaycaster bug that prevented using laser pointers as UI input.
